1-List of files:
assign2 directory: index.php,mysqlcommand.txt, xhr.js,readme.txt.
config directory: sqlSettings.php.
Booking directory: booking.html,booking.js,bookingprocess.php,booking.css.
Admin directory:admin.html,search.js,searchprocess.php,admin.css

2-How to use the system:
In the assign2 directory, the user has to run the index.php file which will redirect the user
to the booking.html file in the booking directory where he/she can start using the system.
The user can also easily go to admin mode by clicking on the link text at the end of the page.
The link will redirect the user to admin.html file in the Admin directory.
The user can easily switch back to the booking system by the link text provided in the admin.html page.

Unfortunately, I don't have time to figure out how to make the assign button work to change the 
unassigned text in the table that would be shown to the user upon searching for a booking reference
number. I will make this functional later during the holidays.
